# Intro

A Combination of Another custom sigil mod, Extra Sigils and AnthonysSigils. Currently at... 150+ new or tweaked vanilla sigils. Do note, this pack has some negative Sigils in it. However there are way more good sigils than bad.

You can find all the sigils in this mod and their descriptions here:

## Installation (automated)
This is the recommended way to install the API on the game.

- Download and install [Thunderstore Mod Manager](https://www.overwolf.com/app/Thunderstore-Thunderstore_Mod_Manager) or [r2modman](https://timberborn.thunderstore.io/package/ebkr/r2modman/)
- Click Install with Mod Manager button on top of the [page]
- Run the game via the mod manager

- IF YOU MANUALLLY INSTALL THE MOD, PUT THE CONTENTS OF THE PLUGINFOLDER TOGETHER! Lily and Anthony's sigils look for an Artwork folder in the directory that their .dll is in. so it will error if they are apart.
