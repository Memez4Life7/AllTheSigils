## Installation
This is the recommended way to install this mod.

- Download and install [Thunderstore Mod Manager](https://www.overwolf.com/app/Thunderstore-Thunderstore_Mod_Manager) or [r2modman](https://timberborn.thunderstore.io/package/ebkr/r2modman/)
- Click on the "Install with Mod Manager" button at the top of this page
- Start the game via the mod manager

- IF YOU MANUALLY INSTALL THIS MOD, TAKE THE CONTENTS OUT OF THE PLUGINS FOLDER! Some sigils look for their artwork in specific folders in the directory that the .dll is in, so if that specific directory doesn't exist the mod wil break.
